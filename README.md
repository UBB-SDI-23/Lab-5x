Continue working on the application from the previous assignment. Push your project to this repository.

You will need to:

- Implement at least one CRUD and one filter / statististical report on the frontend.
- Deploy the frontend either on https://www.netlify.com/ (or equivalent) or on your virtual machine. If you choose netlify or equivalent, it should deploy automatically when you commit to github.
